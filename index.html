        I’m a creative. I have spent the better part of my life pursuing a career in music. The sound that caught me at a young age was Hip-Hop. Naturally, like many young kids growing up in The Bronx, I wanted to be a rapper. Well, technically I am a rapper, but I wanted the notoriety that is reserved for those few famous ones. So I worked at it -for years. I wrote my own lyrics, produced my own beats, recorded my own vocals, booked my own shows, I even edited my own videos.. until eventually I caught the attention of a record label.

        I had just finished my first year at Baruch College when this small indie label from Switzerland expressed interest in my music. The label would help allocate funds for my production and artistic development. I went on to work with the label and got to travel with my music. I toured in Switzerland and Sweden. Back in the states I performed at festivals like SXSW in Austin TX. I played all kinds bars and clubs throughout New York and New Jersey. I even busked on NYC subway platforms. I just wanted to spread the music, at any cost.

        But something happened at the start of 2018. I started to fall out of love with the idea of being “famous”, and the growing demands up-and-coming artists have to face. I started to see how in this age of information and social media, it is getting harder and harder to retain the average person’s attention. As a result, most of the media that sticks is hyper-sensationalized (often at the expense of artistry or integrity). The Hip-Hop that grabbed me as a kid had finally loosened its grip, allowing me to set my eyes on a new goal.

        The internet changed the music industry forever. In fact, I struggle to think of an industry that’s remained unaffected by the internet. It’s been amazing to witness the tech-boom we are living in. But I don’t want to just experience this new world, I want to help shape it. The world of code fascinates me at my core. I believe the <strong>Innovation Fellowship at The Knowledge House</strong> will be a great launching point to a new career, and will equip me with the tools I need to contribute to the music industry’s on-going evolution.
